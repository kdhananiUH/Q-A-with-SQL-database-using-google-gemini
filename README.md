# Text-to-SQL-to-Answering-your-question

+ First of all, SQL or SQlite database is connected.
+ User can ask any question in the input, and the model will generate the SQL query of that question.
+ Then, it'll talk with database and will give an answer accordingly.
+ I have used 'genimi-pro'LLM model of Google GenerativeAI in this application.

+ For example, Let's take below database:
![llm](https://github.com/kdhananiUH/Q-A-with-SQL-database-using-google-gemini/assets/111707291/f61a3e1b-cad4-4e53-9b5b-94594ec7b428)

Now, we'll test our model with some questions:

+ We can see, the model is giving correct answers
